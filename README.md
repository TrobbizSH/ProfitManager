# ProfitManager
A personal project to better learn the SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Programing and the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

The goal is to make a desktop application in C# where one can track his income and the money he spent throughout a week/month/year/etc.
The software has no commercial use, it is something I wanted to make for a long time and to learn WPF and the SOLID-Principles.

## Project Goals
* Interface with an overview of how much income and payings where made in a set time period (particular week/month/year)
* You cann add income and payings and assign them a category (e.g. Household, Groceries, Car, Public Transport, etc.)
* You cann also add a comment to each income/paying to better track the money.
* Data Persistence via Files
